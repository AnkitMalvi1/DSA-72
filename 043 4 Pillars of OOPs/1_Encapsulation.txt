1. Encapsulation:

wrapping up data members & functions.

data members-> ...
functions->  ,,,
[...|,,,]-> class

Fully Encapsulated Class: all data members -> private

"Information hiding/ Data hiding"

Advantages:
-> Data Hide -> security |
-> if we want, we can make class - read only
-> code reusability
-> unit testing
