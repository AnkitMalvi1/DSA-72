          Son
 brother [Ank] husband
         father

Types of Polymorphism:
(A) Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)
(B) Run-time Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)

(A) Compile-time Polymorphism:
-> Function Overloading ->
{
    func(){}
    func(int name){}
    func(char ch){}
    func(int age,double value){}
}
-> Operator Overloading ->
Operators that cannot be overloaded:-
::  .*  .  ?:

(B) Run-time Polymorphism:
-> Method/ Function Overriding
   Rules: -> Inheritance is must.
          -> func() name same.
          -> func() args same.
